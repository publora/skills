# Telegram Post

Create and schedule posts to Telegram channels and groups using the Publora MCP server. Supports rich markdown formatting, photos, videos, and message delivery options.

## Prerequisites

**Plans:** Works on the free Starter plan. Current limits and pricing: [publora.com/pricing](https://publora.com/pricing).

### Getting Started

1. **Create account** at [publora.com/register](https://publora.com/register) (free)
2. **Create Telegram bot:**
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
   - Send `/newbot` and follow instructions
   - Save the bot token
4. **Add bot to your channel:**
   - Add the bot as **administrator** to your channel/group
   - Grant `can_post_messages` permission
5. **Connect in Publora** at [Dashboard](https://app.publora.com/dashboard) with bot token and channel name
6. **Get API key** at [app.publora.com/dashboard/api](https://app.publora.com/dashboard/api)
7. **Connect your agent** to the MCP server at `https://mcp.publora.com`, authenticating with `Authorization: Bearer sk_YOUR_API_KEY`. In Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add publora --transport http https://mcp.publora.com \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer sk_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

   Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw and the claude.ai connector each need a different config file or flow: see [client setup](https://docs.publora.com/mcp/client-setup) for the exact path and snippet.

### REST API Fallback

If the MCP server is unavailable or returns errors, use the REST API directly:

**Base URL:** `https://api.publora.com/api/v1`

**Authentication:** Use `x-publora-key` header (NOT `Authorization: Bearer`):

```bash
# Get your connected platforms
curl -X GET "https://api.publora.com/api/v1/platform-connections" \
  -H "x-publora-key: sk_your_api_key"

# Create a post
curl -X POST "https://api.publora.com/api/v1/create-post" \
  -H "x-publora-key: sk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platforms": ["telegram-1001234567890"],
    "content": "*Announcement*\n\nYour message here",
    "scheduledTime": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

**Platform ID Format:** `telegram-{chat_id}` where `{chat_id}` is the channel/group numeric ID from `/platform-connections`.

Example IDs: `telegram-1001234567890`, `telegram--1002345678901`

## Platform Limits (Bot API)

| Feature | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Text message | 4,096 characters |
| **Media caption** | **1,024 characters** (critical limit!) |
| Images | 10 MB max, 10 per media group |
| Image formats | JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP |
| **Video size** | **50 MB max** (not 4 GB - that's for users!) |
| Video formats | MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM |
| Rate limit | 30 msg/sec global, 20 msg/min per group |

**Critical:** Bot API has much lower limits than regular Telegram users. Videos over 50 MB and captions over 1,024 characters will fail.

## Markdown Formatting

Telegram uses its own markdown flavor with **single asterisks** for bold:

| Syntax | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `*bold*` | **bold** |
| `_italic_` | *italic* |
| `` `code` `` | `inline code` |
| ``` ```code``` ``` | Code block |
| `[text](url)` | [hyperlink](url) |
| `> text` | Blockquote |

**Note:** This differs from standard Markdown where `**double asterisks**` make bold.

## Available Tools

### create_post
Create a new Telegram post.

**Parameters:**
- `platforms`: Array with your Telegram connection ID (e.g., `["telegram-1001234567890"]`)
- `content`: Message text (supports markdown)
- `scheduledTime`: ISO 8601 UTC datetime. **Optional**: omit it and the post is created as a draft. Send a future time to schedule. A time five or more minutes in the past is rejected with `SCHEDULED_TIME_IN_PAST`, so for immediate posting use the current time plus a minute.
- `mediaUrls`: up to 10 public **https** image or video URLs. Publora downloads them server-side and attaches them *before* validation, so media and scheduling happen in one call. This is the one-shot alternative to the draft then `get_upload_url` then `complete_media` flow. Ingestion is rate-limited to 60 URLs per hour.

### get_upload_url
Get presigned URL for media uploads.

### complete_media
Finalize a file uploaded through `get_upload_url`, after the presigned `PUT` succeeds. Optional, because scheduling also finalizes pending media, but calling it early surfaces format and probe errors before publish. Not needed for media attached with `mediaUrls`.

**Parameters:**
- `mediaId`: the id returned by `get_upload_url`

### list_connections
List your connected accounts with their platform IDs. Call this first and copy the IDs verbatim; they are never guessable.

### list_posts / get_post / update_post / delete_post
Manage scheduled and draft posts. `update_post` also patches `content` and `platforms` on a draft or scheduled post, so fixing a typo or retargeting no longer means delete and recreate. `delete_media` and `prune_media_reference` clean up uploaded files.

## Post Options (via REST API)

Telegram-specific options available via REST API `platformSettings.telegram`:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `disableNotification` | Send silently (no sound) |
| `disableWebPagePreview` | No link preview cards |
| `showCaptionAboveMedia` | Caption above image/video |
| `protectContent` | Prevent forwarding/saving |

Note: `platformSettings` is not available via MCP - use REST API for these options.

## Examples

### Simple Channel Post
```
Post this to my Telegram channel:
"*Product Update v2.5*

We have shipped the following improvements:
- _Faster API response times_ (avg 45ms)
- New `batch` endpoint for bulk operations

[Read the changelog](https://example.com/changelog)"
```

### Formatted Announcement
```
Create a Telegram post with this formatting:
"*Important Update*

We're launching our new feature tomorrow at 10 AM UTC.

_What's new:_
- Feature A improvements
- Feature B release

[Read the full announcement](https://example.com/update)"
```

### Post with Image
```
Post this image to my Telegram channel with caption:
"*New Dashboard Preview*

Here's a sneak peek at our redesigned analytics dashboard."
```
**Important:** Caption must be under 1,024 characters when posting with media.

### Scheduled Post
```
Schedule this for tomorrow at 8 AM Moscow time:
"*Good morning!* Here's your daily market summary..."
```

## Important Restrictions

1. **Caption limit is 1,024 chars**: When posting with media (images/videos), text is sent as a caption limited to 1,024 characters. Text-only messages allow 4,096 characters.

2. **Video max 50 MB**: Bot API limits videos to 50 MB (not 4 GB like regular users). Large videos will fail.

3. **Bot must be admin**: Your bot needs administrator role with `can_post_messages` permission. This is verified at connection time.

4. **No mixed media**: A single post cannot contain both images and videos.

5. **Caption overflow**: If caption exceeds 1,024 chars on a media post, it's sent as a separate reply message instead of being truncated.

## Best Practices

### Content
1. **Use formatting**: Bold headlines, italic emphasis improves readability
2. **Link previews**: Great for articles; disable for cleaner announcements
3. **Emoji usage**: Common and expected on Telegram
4. **Post length**: No penalty for longer posts on text-only messages

### Timing
- **Global audience**: Telegram users are worldwide; consider timezone posts
- **Best times**: 8-10 AM, 12-2 PM, 7-9 PM in target regions
- **Frequency**: Channels can post more frequently (5-10/day)

### Engagement
- Enable comments in channel settings for discussions
- Use polls for engagement
- Pin important announcements

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Bot not admin" | Bot missing admin permissions | Add bot as admin with `can_post_messages` |
| "Channel not found" | Wrong channel name/ID | Verify `@channelname` or numeric chat ID |
| `MEDIA_CAPTION_TOO_LONG` | Caption > 1,024 chars | Shorten caption or use text-only post |
| "Bad Request: file is too big" | File > 50 MB | Compress video/image to under 50 MB |
| "Mixed media not supported" | Images + video in same post | Use one media type per post |
